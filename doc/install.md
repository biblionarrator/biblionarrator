Installing Biblionarrator
=========================

*NOTE*: If you are installing Biblionarrator for testing or development purposes
you may want to use Vagrant for the installation. In that case, see the section
at the end entitled [Vagrant installation]

Requirements
------------

Biblionarrator requires a server with the following:

* Node.js 0.8+
* npm (node package manager)
* grunt
* Redis

These instructions assume you will be using Titan with Apache Cassandra
and ElasticSearch 0.90+. However, depending on your desired configuration, you
may not need one or both of them.

If you are setting up a development environment, you will also need git.

Installation procedure
----------------------

0) Install Java 6 or Java 7 from Oracle following the procedure appropriate to
   your operating system.

1) Install Node.js from http://nodejs.org/

   A PPA is available for Debian/Ubuntu, and Node.js is available for
   Fedora/CentOS/RHEL from the EPEL repository.

2) Install Cassandra by following the instructions at http://www.datastax.com/documentation/gettingstarted/index.html

3) Install ElasticSearch from http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/#installation

4) Install redis from http://redis.io/
   
   On Debian/Ubuntu:

   and generate API documentation. If you do not want to do those three things
   in addition to the regular build, you can use:

    grunt build

9) Run the grunt-based installer and answer the questions based on your planned
   configuration

    grunt install
