Biblionarrator - a new type of cataloging system
================================================

About
-----

Biblionarrator turns traditional assumptions about cataloging on their
heads and makes catalogs (and cataloging) fun again. This catalog has
been designed for bibliophile and bibliographer alike and offers
unprecedented flexibility and power in that most important of all tasks,
bibliographic description.

Biblionarrator is currently used in production by a number of collections.
