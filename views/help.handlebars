            <div class="row-fluid">
                <div class="span6">
                    <p>As one might expect, Biblionarrator offers powerful <a href="/search">Search</a>
                    features via the link and Quick search box in the menu bar at the top of the screen.
                    Unlike with other catalogue systems, however, once you do a search Biblionarrator
                    will offer you powerful tools to understand your results and identify the material
                    you need.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Knowledge trails</h3>
                    <p>When you are trying to dig deeper into a subject, you can use Biblionarrator to
                    follow the &#8220;knowledge trail&#8221; to related books, people, articles, and
                    subjects by clicking the <i class="explore-icon"></i> icon.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Landmarks</h3>
                    <p>If, in the course of your research, you find books or articles that meet your
                    needs, Biblionarrator offers you the ability to mark them as &#8220;landmarks&#8221;,
                    so that the system can search for related records for you. You can mark a record as a
                    landmark by clicking the <i class="landmark-icon"></i> icon.
                    </p>

                <div class="span6">
                    <h3>Visualizations</h3>
                    <p>Biblionarrator's most surprising feature, though, is surely its visualizations.
                    Using the &#8220;Visualize search&#8221; button in the control bar at the bottom of
                    any results page, you can easily visualize the part of the collection that is most
                    relevant to your query.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you have identified some landmarks in your searching, clicking the
                    &#8220;Visualize landmarks&#8221; button will show you not just the landmarks but
                    also a map of the records most relevant to your landmarks.
